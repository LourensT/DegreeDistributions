# Degree Distributions

A wrapper for `networkx` for calculating various empirical degree distributions:
* Empirical Degree Distribution 
* Size-biased Degree Distribution
* Random-friend-distribution

The size-biased is defined in 1.2.2 of Random Graphs and Complex Networks by Remco van der Hofstad.  The random friend distribution is the degree distribution of a uniformly selected adjacent vertex to a uniformly selected vertex in the network).
